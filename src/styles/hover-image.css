     * an element with z-index: -1 might be hidden behind that background.
     * If the image doesn't appear, try changing this to a positive value (e.g., z-index: 10;)
     * and ensure other critical elements (like a navigation bar) have a higher z-index if needed.
     * For now, we'll use a positive z-index (e.g., 10) to ensure it's generally visible above
     * static page content but below potential pop-ups or main navigation.
     * Adjust this value based on your site's specific layering.
